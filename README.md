Pizza Sales Analysis Project
Introduction
Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis Project! This project aims to provide insights into pizza sales data by leveraging SQL queries to extract, analyze, and visualize key performance metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding customer preferences, revenue generation, and order patterns within the pizza industry.

In todayâ€™s competitive market, data-driven decision-making is essential for businesses to thrive. By analyzing pizza sales data, we can uncover valuable trends and patterns that can inform marketing strategies, menu development, and operational improvements. This project is structured to cater to varying levels of analytical complexity, allowing users to engage with the data at different depths:

Basic Analysis
Retrieve essential metrics such as total orders and revenue generated from pizza sales.
Identify the highest-priced pizza and the most commonly ordered size.
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
Intermediate Analysis
Join relevant tables to analyze the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
Examine the distribution of orders by the hour of the day.
Calculate category-wise distribution and average pizzas ordered per day.
Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
Advanced Analysis
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
Analyze cumulative revenue generated over time.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each category.
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the power of SQL in transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights. We hope this analysis will inspire further exploration and provide a foundation for optimizing pizza sales strategies.

Feel free to explore the repository for SQL queries, data models, and visualizations that support the analyses outlined above. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome!
